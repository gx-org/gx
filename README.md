# GX: a Domain Specific Programming Language for Array-Computing

GX aims at defining a strongly typed programming language to define functions
operating on arrays and running on accelerators such as GPUs, TPUs. A key
difference with Python and many programming languages is that array dimension
are part of the type of an object. Also, GX aims
at being easy to integrate with existing programming language such as Go,
Python, or C++ by providing utilities to generate bindings.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official Google DeepMind product (experimental or otherwise), it is
just code that happens to be owned by Google-DeepMind. GX is experimental and work
in progress. As of today, we do not consider any part of the language as stable. Breaking
changes will happen on a regular basis.
